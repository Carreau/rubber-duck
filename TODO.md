# TODO
 * Maybe streamline it down to just one macro
 * Rename and clean up the base macro _OR_ create an impl in the crate
 * Move base to require and reexport the proc macros
 * Add better rust doc for generated macro (specifying name, and which options are optional, and links to the struct)
 * Add better rust doc for generate builder (specifying name, and which fields are optional, and links to original struct)
 * Add a way to prefix things with positional arguments?
