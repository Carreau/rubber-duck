# TODO
 * Maybe streamline it down to just one macro
 * Add better rust doc for generated macro (specifying name, and which options are optional, and links to the struct)
 * Add better rust doc for generate builder (specifying name, and which fields are optional, and links to original struct)
 * Add example of macro expansion
